/*
Description:    Prepares XML data files for further use of the program.
                Necessary function for parsing the files and getting their root
                nodes are called. Pointers to prepared documents and root nodes
                are stored in a provided struct. If an error occurs while
                performing one of these operations, an error message is
                displayed. Also resources are freed safely and the program is
                closed.
                
Parameters:     *ptrs - A struct that will hold pointers to parsed documents and
                their root nodes, that the program will use. Pointers need to be
                initialized as NULL pointers.
                
Return:         -
